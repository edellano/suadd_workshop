title: 1st SUADD Challenge
---

This workshop is organized together with the Amazonâ€™s Scene Understanding Challenge 2023. The dataset of the challenge consisted of birdseye-view images taken between 5m and 25m AGL. Annotations for the semantic segmentation task are fully labeled images, across 16 distinct classes. Annotations for the mono-depth estimation task have been computed with geometric stereo-depth algorithms.

The evaluation of the challenge will be carried according to the instructions provided on the challenge rules on a private test set. There are two separate benchmarks, one for the semantic segmentation task and another for the mono-depth estimation task. In particular the mean IoU will be used as main metric to rank the semantic segmentation leader-board, and the Scale invariant logarithmic error is the main metric used to rank the mono-depth estimation leader-board.
