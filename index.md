title: Overview
---

**Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)** have been employed for a wide variety of applications, such as environmental studies, emergency responses or package delivery. Safe operation of fully autonomous UAS requires robust perception systems. In the SUADD workshop, we will focus on the **estimation of the depth and the semantic segmentation of the scene**. The results of these two tasks can help the development of safe and reliable autonomous control systems for the aircraft. This workshop is part of a wider initiative at [**Amazon Prime Air**](https://www.aboutamazon.de/news/innovationen/prime-air), which includes the organization of a challenge on semantic segmentation and mono-depth estimation of drone images, which had hundreds of participants. The images of the dataset of the challenge comprised realistic backyard scenarios of variable content and have been taken on various Above Ground Level (AGL) ranges. With this workshop and challenge we aim to inspire the Computer Vision community to develop new insights and advance the state of the art in perception tasks involving drone images. The workshop will also include talks by invited speakers.
